Group: Adam Marrs, Shaquann Seadrow, Riley Clarke
Primarily done indvidually. I had trouble on the cross-validation segment and asked some questions that started a discussion.
Teammates helped in clarifying some things and confirming they were getting same data (I was confused about using cv.y). Riley printed 
out his values for one to confirm my results of cv repeating month indices.
