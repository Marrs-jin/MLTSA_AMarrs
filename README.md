Group: Adam Marrs (me), Riley Clarke, Shaquann Seadrow
Due to uncertainty in forming labs, we did not get together until further in the week.
This lab was done mostly individually. Riley created the Slack group and posted the data table for the extra credit.
Riley also answered an uncertainty that I had regarding the args keyword in making the function.
Aside from that work was done individually. In the future I will strive to make a more teamwork-focused setting so we can work together.
