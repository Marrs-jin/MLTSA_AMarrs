Group: Adam Marrs, Riley Clarke, Shaquann Seadrow. Some more talking together in the group, but all coding was done indivdually.
I asked several questions in the Slack, but was able to come to an answer for all of them before help was provided. I then posted that, 
which may or may not have been helpful to other group members. 
I helped answer some questions about basic google collaboraty features.
